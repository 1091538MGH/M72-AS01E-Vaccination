For model fitting you should run these two
Note that after running the model for 250 years the model reached the equlibrium but at lower values than those in observed data. Hence we ultimately used that to estimate parameter values at equlibrium to fit our model.

And for scenario analyses run these two

Due to time we couldnt run sensitivity analyses, but we explain what we should have done.
